# Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis

## Project Description

In this project, you will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to identify the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across six countries.

Throughout the project, you will engage in data analysis, preparation, and visualization to answer key questions in a meaningful way. Your findings will be shared in a blog post on the World Health Organization website.

## Going off platform
For this particular project, you will be using Jupyter Notebook and Git version control. If you need help with your setup, read our articles about getting started off platform:
- Command Line Interface Setup
- Introducing Jupyter Notebook
- Setting up Jupyter Notebook
- Getting Started with Jupyter
- Getting More out of Jupyter Notebook

If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for version control, review the GitHub Desktop article and additional help on this Git cheat sheet.

## Debugging Tips + Helpful Resources
Feeling stuck? Try the following:
- Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how other folks have found solutions.
- Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
- Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.
